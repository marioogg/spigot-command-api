/**
 * Marks a class as a subcommand group. All {@link Command}-annotated methods inside
 * the class will automatically have the root names defined here prepended to their own names.
 *
 * <p>A blank root name ({@code ""}) is treated as the root command itself — the method names
 * are registered as-is, without any prefix. This is useful when a single class needs to
 * handle both the base command and its subcommands side-by-side
